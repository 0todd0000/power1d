The following datasets are synthetic,
created using the "rfrt1d.randn1d" random number generator:
- array_multi.csv
- array_multi.csv.gz
- array_single_col.csv
- array_single_col.csv.gz
- array_single_row.csv
- array_single_row.csv.gz
(CSV and CSV.GZ files are included to demonstrate that power1d can handle both formats)



The "Atlantic" dataset is a subset of the "weather" dataset:
- Atlantic.csv
- Atlantic.mat
- Atlantic.npy.gz
This dataset was made available by Prof. James O. Ramsay
of McGill University. The dataset was download from:
http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/misc/fda/downloads/FDAfuns/Matlab
on 28 March 2017 (see the ./examples/weather directory).

No license was found with that dataset. Only "daily.m" and
"daily.mat" from that dataset are redistributed here, on
the condition that the original source be acknowledged.

The dataset is described here:
http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/misc/fda/ex-weather-a1.html
... and also in:
Ramsay JO, Silverman BW (2005). Functional Data Analysis
(Second Edition), Springer, New York.
Chapter 13: "Modelling functional responses with
multivariate covariates"

The data are also saved in NumPy format as "daily.npz"
for more convenient access from Python.




The "Neptune1999kneeflex.csv" dataset is a subset of
the Neptune et al. (1999) public dataset
